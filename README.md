A Resso Downloader by Varun ojha

## Install
```
npm i redifly
```

## Use
```
npx redifly
```

## Note
```
Do not enter a system root level download location or two level deep from the root, the app may crash. 

Also there are a few songs that may crash the app. Remove those songs from the playlist. This is a bug and I am working on it.
```

## Detailed Use for beginners
1. First make sure node is installed. if not download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). I recommend the LTS version as it is stable.
2. Then open a command prompt(cmd) or any other terminal like bash in VS code(shortcut : `ctrl + ~ `). If you are still having problem search for `command` by pressing `win + s` and it should show up.
3. Then type `npm i redifly` and press enter.
4. Now type `npx redifly` and press enter and the app should start.
